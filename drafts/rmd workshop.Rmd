# Useful tips and tricks

(thats the piece of code at the top of your RMarkdown document that appears between the triple dashes), and how you can use it to get handy things like a table of contents, and add a theme to you documents so that you can customise fonts etc.

We learned about how to create parameterised reports; by using parameters in your Markdown document and the purrr package you can generate separate reports for separate groups of kids (for example), automatically.
