When I got an email from Hadley last week inviting me to attend his Tidy Tools workshop on a dviersity scholarship I was initially honoured and excited, and then really nervous. I have been learning for a mere 18 months, and still think of myself as a beginner - do I know enough to get anything out of a Tidy Tools workshop? 

At the end of day 1, I am definitely in the bottom of the learning pit.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was at my daughter’s school yesterday and noticed this art on the wall in the stairway. Navigating the learning pit is something we all have to do.

But I am not feeling like quitting. I just need to take a moment to reflect on what I learned today, so that I can sleep (maybe consolidate a little) and walk into tomorrow ready to take on more. 

Some thoughts...

Hadley was right when he said you will get most out of this course if you have a good handle on writing functions and subsetting. I skimmed the recommended text chapters before going but definitely think I would have been happier today, with a little more { }, [], [[]] experience under my belt. 

## Day 1 topics and takeaways

Hadley is writing a book, its a poorly kept secret right now but will contain lots of the Tidy Tools content in the form of design principles. Keep an eye on https:://principles.tidyverse.org.

### 1. Basics

####Vectors

There are 4 types of atomic vector
1. logical (T, F, NA)
2. integer
3. double
4. character

And 2 extra uncommon ones
5. raw (binary)
6. complex

Vectors have 3 fundamental properties
1. typeof(x)
2. length
3. attributes

#### An aside about NA
Q= What does NA == NA return?
A= NA

Why? 

Think about if you dont know marys age (NA) and you dont know johns age (NA), if you ask if marys age == johns age, you can't know

is.na() returns true false to tell you if a value is NA or not; if you sum logicals false is 0 true is 1, so...

sum(is.na(x)) = count NAs
mean(is.na(x))= proportion NAs

####Subsetting 

6 types of things you can put in x[y]

1. nothing 

x[] gets everything back, useful with dataframes

df[1:3, ] get first 3 rows, and all of the columns

2. logical

x[x > 5] = all values of x where [x > 5] is true

3. positive integers

x[c(1,3)] gets values at those positions

4. negative integers

x[-4] drops that position

5. zero 
x[0] get nothing back

6. character

y <- c(a=1, b=2, c=3)
y[c("b", "a", "c")] gets names

##### Change your mental model of the assignment

<- doesn't make a copy, it gives something name, references the other thing

###RStudio tips and tricks x 10

1. find things you have typed recently

Cmd up arrow --- type a few char, searchs history to find things you have typed before 

2. run current expression

Cmd enter--- run current exp, works for a whole pipe

3. multiple cursors 

Alt-drag to get many cursors and do same operation on every line

4. to get keyboard shortcuts help

Alt shift K

5. assignment <-

Alt MINUS <- 

6. comment a block of lines 

Cmd shift C

7. Pipe %>%

Cmd Shift M

8. restart R session

Cmd Shift F10

9. get time stamp

ts shift tab gets to current time stamp

```{r}
# Wed May  1 09:47:43 2019 ------------------------------

```
10. search for functions/files

Ctrl . 

#2. Packages

#Why use projects?
1. switch between mutiple Rstudio sessions easily
2. deal with working directory problems
3. find files/functions using ctrl .

# Why packages?
- workflow
- conventions
- sharing

It was WAY easier than I thought it would be to create a package. Create_package makes a strcuture of directories/files that will house your package.  

```
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/mypackage")
```


#Package workflow
change code--- load_all() [cmd shift L] --- check in console and repeat

#Time for ponies

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3K5yWYGYZpgIg/giphy.gif)

rpony is a toy package that we played with to practice functions. 
Make a list of ponies, the rpony() function samples n times from them.

```{r}

ponies <- c(
  "Twilight Sparkle",
  "Rainbow Dash",
  "Pinkie Pie",
  "Applejack",
  "Rarity",
  "Fluttershy"
)
 
rpony <- function(n) {
  sample(ponies, n, replace = TRUE)
}


```

###Writing functions problem 
Make a new function sort the ponies in alphabetical order. 

First make a new file. 

```
usethis::use_r("show")
```


1. work out how you would solve the problem, sort the ponies alphabetically

ponies %>%
  sort()
  
OR sort(ponies)

2. then put that solution in your function

show_pony <- function(n) {
  sort(ponies)
}


# 3. Unit Tests

Trying to write functions off the bat is a bad idea. Make fake data and try it out as you go. 

How to make play df
```
# Some simple inputs
df1 <- data.frame(a = 3, b = 4, c = 5)
df2 <- data.frame(X = 1, Y = 2)

df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y= 5:1)
```


Problems
- testing informally Cmd Enter can miss things
- looking at outputs is tedious

Solutions 
- use devtools::load_all to run
- use devtools::test to test

Expectations organised into Tests, and Tests organised into Files. 

#### Testing Workflow
1. create package
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/hadcol")

2. make new file to house function
usethis::use_r("insert_into")

3. set up testing infrastructure
usethis::use_test()

4. Run Tests
devtools::test() [Cmd Shift T]

Tests formalise the Expections you have for the output. 


####Test coverage

test_coverage()
tets_coverage_file()
-- tell you which lines you have tested

# 4. Interface design

base R reg exp are bad for many reasons. 
- it isnt clear what they do from their name, not verbs
- arguments order, not consistent
- output of one isn't necessarily the input of another (not pipable)

#### stringr case

function design principles
- names
-- use verbs for functions that do stuff 
-- nouns for builidng things (i.e. ggplot)
- prefixes group related functions together (i.e. str_)
- suffixes for variations on a theme (i.e. str_extract vs str_extract_all)
- plan for the pipe
--- nice because you can read from left to right and dont need to create intermediary steps
- arguments
--- data first, details later
- match outputs and inputs


# 5. Functional programming

###why use purrr?
It is best to avoid copy and paste (errors), and for loops are bad

for loops emphasise objects rather than actions

How to view structure of object?

str()
View()


What is the difference between [ and [[]]]
- use single when you want to select multiple
- use double when you want to select single element

Vectors 
single x[[1]] get first element
multiple x[1:4] gets elements 1-4

Lists 
single x[[1]] or x$name
multiple x[1] 

MAP strategy
1. solve for single .x
2. generalise across all elements with appropriate map
3. simplify if possible


Map problems 
A. computer M for every column of mtcars

1. Solve for a single .x

```
#define .x as first column of mtcars
.x <- mtcars[[1]]

#get mean of .x
mean(.x)

```

2. Generalise across all using map
```
map_dbl(mtcars, ~ mean(.x))
```

3. Simplify

```
map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
```

B. calc 10 random normals for the following means (-10, 0, 10, 100)

```
mu <- c(-10, 0, 10, 100)
# define .x as first element of mu, Solve for one
.x <- mu[[1]]

rnorm(10, mean = .x)
```


```
# Generalise
map(mu, ~ rnorm(10, mean = .x))
```

```
# Simplify (optional)
map(mu, rnorm, n = 10)
```




C. compute the number of unique values in each column of iris

```
# Solve for one
.x <- iris[[1]]
length(unique(.x))

```

```
# Generalise
map_int(iris, ~ length(unique(.x)))

```

```
# Simplify ?
nunique <- function(x) length(unique(x))
map_int(iris, ~ nunique(.x))
map_int(iris, nunique)
```
