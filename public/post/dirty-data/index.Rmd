I have been doing lots of data wrangling recently and decided a needed a quick rundown of data cleaning in R. Turns out www.DataCamp.com has a course called exactly that. Here are notes on useful things I learned.

#### Quick summaries

`class()` will let you know whether you are working with a dataframe or not

`dim()` gives you a little info about the dimensions of your data by telling you how many rows nd columns you have

`names()` will print the column names

`str()` aka structure and `glimpse()`, from dplyr, give you slightly different versions of hte same thing, a list of variables, each with a data type and a preview of the data

`summary()` will give you a "sometimes useful, sometimes not" summary of each variable. You get a distribution of numeric things and frequencies of categorical things, but it doesn't group_by like you would like it to. 

`skim()` from the `skimr` package gives a slightly more meaningful summary that includes summary stats for each variable by data type, details about missing values and draws the cutest little histograms you have EVER seen. 

`head()` and `tail()` will show you the top and bottom 6 rows, you can add an argument and specify how many rows you want to see. i.e. head(data, n=12) would show the top 12 rows. 

`print()` will show you all the data in the console, which could be useful depending how big your data is. 

#### Quick plots

If `skim()` doesn't do it for you, there are fast ways to visualise your data without diving head first into ggplot

Histogram: to get an idea of the distribution of data in a particular variable use. Can use optional breaks argument to specify how many buckets the data are broken into. 

> hist(dataset$variable1, breaks = 20)

Scatterplot: to plot the relation between variable 1 and 2 from the dataset use

> plot(dataset$variable1 , dataset$variable2) 

### tidyr 

How do we know data is not tidy? Often because columns are values not variables names. 

#### From wide to long 

Use gather(data, key, value, ...) 

1. data = the dataframe you want to morph from wide to long

2. key = the name of the new column that is levels of what is represented in the wide format as many columns

3. value = the name of the column that will contain the values

4. ... = columns to gather, or leave (use -column to gather all except that one)

#### From long to wide 

Use spread(data, key, value) 

1. data = the dataframe you want to morph from long to wide

2. key = the name of the column that contains the key 

3. value = the name of the column contains the values

#### Separate one column into many 

Use separate(data, col, into) 

1. data = dataframe

2. col = name of column to separate

3. into = character vector of new column [note- these need quotes]

> separate(treatments, year_no, c("year", "month"))

`separate()` assumes you want to split on a space, period, forward slash or dash. You can give it an extra argument sep = "-" to specify what to separate on. 

#### Unite many columns into one 

Use unite(data, col, ...) 

1. data = dataframe

2. col = name of column to separate

3. ... = bare names of columns to unite


### Common sources of mess

1. column headers are values, not variable names --- fix it by using the `gather()` function to combine the many columns into one

2. variables are stored in both rows and columns --- fix it by using the `spread()` function to combine the many columns into one

3. multiple variables are stored in one column --- fix it by using the `separate()` function to split a column into many

Other problems
4. single observational unit stored in multiple tables
5. multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table

### Preparing data for analysis

#### Data type conversions

Changing the data type is called coercing. 

as.character

as.numeric

as.integer

as.factor

as.logical

Use `class()` to learn what kind of data you are dealing with. 

#### lubridate

Often R thinks that dates are strings, so functions from the lubridate package are useful for coercing them to date format. 

i.e. ymd("2015-August-25") will parse a string and return a date in standard YMD format

#### stringr

`str_trim("   string with lots of white space    ")` trims away white space from character input

`str_pad()` adds padding to the left or right of the string 

i.e. this example takes an ID number, makes it 7 digits wide by padding the left side with 0s, result = 0024493

> str_pad("24493", width= 7, side = left, pad = 0) 

`str_detect(data, "stringname")` determine whether a particular string is present, returns TRUE, FALSE 

`str_replace(data, "string1", "string2")` find instances of string1, replace with string2 

`tolower()` and `toupper()` are functions from baseR that convert strings to all lower case or all uppercase. 

#### missing and special values

Use is.na() to check for NAs; will give TRUE or FALSE for each observation.

> is.na(dataframe) 

Are there any() NAs?; will give TRUE if there are any NAs

> any(is.na(dataframe))

How many NAs? Use sum to count. This works because TRUE is represented as 1 and FALSE as 0. 

>sum(is.na(dataframe))

Don't forget that `summary()` also counts how many NAs in each variable as does `skim()`

##### Dealing with missing values rowwise

> complete.cases(dataframe) 

complete cases will give a TRUE FALSE for each row according to whether there are any missing values. You can subset the data, keeping only complete cases using...

> dataframe[complete.cases(dataframe), ]

OR use `na.omit(dataframe)` to keep only NA free data. 

##### Outliers and errors

Use boxplots, summary stats, and histogram to view outliers.
