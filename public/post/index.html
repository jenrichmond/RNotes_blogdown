                                  There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.
Alison Hill I used Alison’s blog post when I first set up this blog. It looks like she has updated the post recently, so it is probably still a good place to start.

                                  I’ve been analysing some future thinking data and playing around with packages that can do repeated ANOVA (I know, I should do LMM). There is more than one way to skin a cat and the differences come down to two things.
the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor

                                  I love me a good #rstats screencast. David Robinson has been screencasting his #TidyTuesday efforts for the past few months and while it is GREAT to watch a master at work, I just don’t have time to watch someone code for an hour, in order to extract a handful of tips.
So when I saw Nick Tierney tweet about posting short videos that contain Just Three Things, I thought “that is a GREAT idea”.

Just use the infinite_moon_reader function from the xaringan package.
It works for all single-HTML-file outputs and even comes with a pre-made RStudio Addin! — Jozef Hajnala (@jozefhajnala) January 2, 2019   When Charles was visiting for #RCurious in June, she had written her slides in xarigan and was raving about infinite moon reader.

                                  Sometimes your plot needs a celebratory gif.
I have just finished the vizwhiz module for #RYouWithMe and to top off the series I worked out how to add an RLady Wizard to our final plot.
Just so I’ll remember for next time, here is a step by step how to…
 how to add a gif to your ggplot Install the magick package and load it with ggplot. Install and load the beepr package too so you can have RStudio beep at you when it has finished rendering your gif (it can take a long time).

On twitter yesterday Alison Hill, Adam Gruer, Zoe Meers and Irene Steves helped me sort out my issues with here.
hi #rstats friends, how do YOU use the here package? I thought I had my head around it but I'm doing something wrong. Here my markdown lives within the “markdown” folder, so I set here to the “data” folder, call read_csv(here(“datafile.

                                  How would we learn R if not for google? Here are some things I googled this week (and mostly not for the first time).
1. how to install a package from github. 95% of the time, packages I want are on CRAN and I can just use the install.packages function to install them.
install.packages(&quot;nameofthepackage&quot;)  Occasionally though, I see something cool and new on Twitter and need to install from github.

                                  Learning new things is HARD. Stats methods are particularly hard because it not just about running the test. You have to…
 learn when to run the test learn how to run the test learn how to interpret the test AND learn how to write about the results of the test  Part of what makes this learning hard is that our research methods training has drummed into us that there is a RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

                                  As I add new projects to my rstats portfolio and work collaboratively on projects with students the issue of working directories is becoming more and more complicated. Not really understanding how working directories and file paths actually work, I have been relying on the beginner logic…
 Everything will be just fine as long as you keep your datafiles in the same folder as your .rmd file
   via GIPHY I aspire to have organized folders that Jen Thompson would be proud of, but that is going involve getting my head around directories.

                                  This content has appeared before in a dirty data post, but I still find myself googling these functions. So they deserve a post of their own. The tidyr package has several functions that allow you to reshape your data. They are surprisely useful; I have found myself gathering a lot, mostly to get data from &ldquo;SPSS format&rdquo; into something that ggplot will handle. I have also discovered the flexibility with which you can spread the data on a particular variable, do a set of computations, and then gather it back for plotting&hellip;.

                                  In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.

                                  It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003
So here is an excellent approach to data wrangling in #rstats https://t.

Turns out that the lsr package doesn’t deal well with tibbles (which are created by default when you use read_csv to get your data) but if you use read.

I&rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).

                                  The frequency with which my data is missing important information when it gets to R is a bit embarrassing. I&rsquo;m sure as I learn what kind of information R needs I&rsquo;ll get better at this but for the moment using functions like rep() to create variables like trial number or block has been super useful.

I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.

LabChart is the software we use to record EMG data and do the first steps of data cleaning/processing. At the moment a good chunk of the cleaning process involves Excel macros, so my goal is to replicate what we have traditionally done in Excel in R, so that it is more automated and more reproducible.</p>

There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn&rsquo;t get to go to).</p>

<p>What a treat it was to finally meet <a href="https://twitter.com/cantabile">Charles Gray</a> when she was in Sydney last week. She ran her R-Curious workshop for us and I picked up so many useful markdown tips.</p>

The people who follow the #rstats hashtag are so generous with their time. You can post a question/problem with the hashtag and someone will reply and try and help you within about 20 min. It is awesome.</p>
