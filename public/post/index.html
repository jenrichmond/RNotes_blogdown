                                  I have set myself a challenge of learning to deal with dates in R. Nothing like setting a date for an R-Ladies Sydney event where you will teach other people to spur the motivation for learning how to use the lubridate package.
The plan is to learn how to use the package and document my learning process along the way so that at the end of Oct I can tell everyone…

                                  Some students have been asking me how they can calcuate means and standard errors by condition. Here is a quick example using the palmer penguin data.
Details of the palmer penguin data, with art by Allison Horst, can be found here.

                                  The scale() function will center and/or scale a numeric object. Use center = TRUE to subtract the mean from the values; use scale = TRUE to divide the centered values by the standard deviation to produce z scores.
center variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
  generate z-scores for variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
 Lets try it with EMG data

Why is my internet speed so terrible? Working from home and pivoting to teaching online has made me realise that my wifi connection is really bad, particularly when it rains. I have been teaching new honours students R and needed a little dataset to demo how to get data into R, so made a google form and put it out on twitter to confirm to myself that my connection really is worse than most other people.

                                  There is no doubt that COVID19 has massively disrupted how we spend our time and money. In this post, I update code inspired by this R-bloggers blog to look at how much less money we have been spending on eating in the last month, compared to April 2019.

Because most of the time I am working with data in long format, you can end up with hundreds of observations, so functions like length() aren’t useful. Today I just wanted to check how many participants were in this dataset and it took me some significant googling.

I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesn’t stick, I can always just google my own blog.

Of course these things are often factors so you need to explicitly convert them if you want to use the factor in an analysis or have it appear the way you want in a ggplot.

                                  I started a blog post and pushed it to the git repo that contains my blog. Charles forked my repo, cloned it to her machine, contributed to the post, and then pushed the updates to her forked copy of the repo.
Then she did a pull request. People in git-land talk about PRs (pull requests) all the time, and the term seems backwards to me. A pull request is when you request that the owner of a repo “pull” the changes that you have made.

When I was first setting up this blog, my dear friend Charles T Gray helped me learn the 3 terminal commands that you need to know to interact with git in the most rudimentary of ways.
 git add .
  git commit -m “something meaningful”
  git push
 Since then I have mostly just used these 3 commands to push blog posts to git.

                                  I had the pleasure of attending Alison Hill’s RMarkdown workshop in Canberra on Monday and I came away with so many tips and tricks! It was brillant.
Alison covered A LOT over the course of the day. I learned lots of the power of yaml, how to create parameterised reports, and how to make a package that contains customised .Rmd templates. Each of those topics are blogposts for another day, but my favourite bit was making a beautiful Academic theme blogdown site.

I have been using gather() and spread() a lot lately. I’m on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.
For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants.

                                  I having been prepping for my lightning talk at the R-Ladies Sydney Birthday this weekend and learning about all the packages that you can use to make memes in R. I’m going going to talk about my favourite option (which is the memery package), but here is what I learned about other packages.
Option 1: memer The memer package by Sam Tyner is a tidyverse compatible package that allows you to replace text in popular memes with your own.

library(tidyverse) library(here) library(papaja)  Read in data plotdata &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;plotdata.

                                  There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.
Alison Hill I used Alison’s blog post when I first set up this blog. It looks like she has updated the post recently, so it is probably still a good place to start.

                                  I’ve been analysing some future thinking data and playing around with packages that can do repeated ANOVA (I know, I should do LMM). There is more than one way to skin a cat and the differences come down to two things.
the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor

David Robinson has been screencasting his #TidyTuesday efforts for the past few months and while it is GREAT to watch a master at work, I just don’t have time to watch someone code for an hour, in order to extract a handful of tips.
So when I saw Nick Tierney tweet about posting short videos that contain Just Three Things, I thought “that is a GREAT idea”.

Just use the infinite_moon_reader function from the xaringan package.
It works for all single-HTML-file outputs and even comes with a pre-made RStudio Addin! — Jozef Hajnala (@jozefhajnala) January 2, 2019   When Charles was visiting for #RCurious in June, she had written her slides in xarigan and was raving about infinite moon reader.

I have just finished the vizwhiz module for #RYouWithMe and to top off the series I worked out how to add an RLady Wizard to our final plot.
Just so I’ll remember for next time, here is a step by step how to…
 how to add a gif to your ggplot Install the magick package and load it with ggplot. Install and load the beepr package too so you can have RStudio beep at you when it has finished rendering your gif (it can take a long time).

1. how to install a package from github. 95% of the time, packages I want are on CRAN and I can just use the install.packages function to install them.
install.packages(&quot;nameofthepackage&quot;)  Occasionally though, I see something cool and new on Twitter and need to install from github.

                                  Learning new things is HARD. Stats methods are particularly hard because it not just about running the test. You have to…
 learn when to run the test learn how to run the test learn how to interpret the test AND learn how to write about the results of the test  Part of what makes this learning hard is that our research methods training has drummed into us that there is a RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

                                  As I add new projects to my rstats portfolio and work collaboratively on projects with students the issue of working directories is becoming more and more complicated. Not really understanding how working directories and file paths actually work, I have been relying on the beginner logic…
 Everything will be just fine as long as you keep your datafiles in the same folder as your .rmd file
   via GIPHY I aspire to have organized folders that Jen Thompson would be proud of, but that is going involve getting my head around directories.

                                  This content has appeared before in a dirty data post, but I still find myself googling these functions. So they deserve a post of their own. The tidyr package has several functions that allow you to reshape your data. They are surprisely useful; I have found myself gathering a lot, mostly to get data from &ldquo;SPSS format&rdquo; into something that ggplot will handle. I have also discovered the flexibility with which you can spread the data on a particular variable, do a set of computations, and then gather it back for plotting&hellip;.

                                  In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.

                                  It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003

                                  I was trying to work out how to do t-tests using my own data and the lsr package but ended up working with Dani’s AFL data from her book while trying to work out why R insisted that my outcome variable wasn’t numeric (it definitely was). Turns out that the lsr package doesn’t deal well with tibbles (which are created by default when you use read_csv to get your data) but if you use read.

                                  I am feeling more confident about my resolution to get rid of Excel and only use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Next steps&hellip; analysis.
I&rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).

                                  The frequency with which my data is missing important information when it gets to R is a bit embarrassing. I&rsquo;m sure as I learn what kind of information R needs I&rsquo;ll get better at this but for the moment using functions like rep() to create variables like trial number or block has been super useful.

                                  I don&rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.
