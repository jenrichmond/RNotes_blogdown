```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Thanks to [Tom Mock](@thomas_mock
) for saving me from this blogpost on twitter. I was monster number 6... beginning to convince myself that there were gremlins in the `across()` function. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("debugging.jpg")
```

In fact, I had forgotten the golden rule: 

> don't make objects that have the same names a functions 

That is for another post...

# the across() function

I have been playing with the new `across()` function in `dplyr` which is a magical solution when you are looking to get several summary statistics across a range of variables. BUT.... working out how to get those summary stats nicely formatted in a table is a bit of a challenge. 

# load packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(skimr)
library(tableone)
library(gt)
```

# get data

Here I am using data from the palmer penguins package. 
```{r}
penguins <- penguins

```

# the goal

```{r}

df <- tibble(penguin_bits = c("bill", "flipper"),
             mean = c(43.92, 200.92), 
             sd = c(5.46, 14.06), 
             min = c(32.1, 172), 
             max = c(59.6, 231))

df %>%
  gt()
```

I want to get summary stats for bill and flipper length (mean, sd, min, and max) and have them display in a nice table like this. But this manual dataframe construction is a bit silly and not at all reproducable. 

> Is there an easy way to get summary stats in this format so they are compatible with the gt package? 


# create summary stats the old way

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(bill_mean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            bill_sd = sd(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
             bill_min = min(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
             bill_max = max(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
             flipper_mean = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            flipper_sd = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
             flipper_min = min(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
             flipper_max = max(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  gt()


```

The summarise function spits out summary stats in a SUPER wide format. 

# create summary stats using `across()`

The new `across()` function gets you the same thing in many fewer lines of code, but still, it is VERY wide. 

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(contains("length"),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, min = min, max = max), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  gt()
```

# skimr

The skimr package is nice because it is tidyverse compatible (i.e. you can select with contains) AND the output can be a dataframe, which you can then edit.  

```{r}
skimtable <- penguins %>%
  select(contains("length")) %>%
  skim()

skimtable
```

<br>
<br>


For my purpose it is more than I need though. There is some selecting and renaming to do after the fact.

```{r}

skimtable_renamed <- skimtable %>%
  select(skim_variable, numeric.mean, numeric.sd, numeric.p0, numeric.p100) %>%
  rename(penguin_bits = skim_variable, mean = numeric.mean, sd = numeric.sd, min = numeric.p0, max = numeric.p100)

```

You do end up with a gt compatible dataframe. 

```{r}

skimtable_renamed %>%
  gt()
```

# tableone package

The TableOne package gives you mean and SD, is there a way to add other summary stats (like min & max to TableOne?) And make the formatted nicer?


```{r}

variables <- c("bill_length_mm", "flipper_length_mm")

CreateTableOne(vars = variables, data = penguins)


```

# summarise + across + pivot ?

Ideally, I want to be able to use `summarise()` and `across()` and somehow make the wide output long. The problem is that `pivot_longer()` will take more than 1 "names_to" argument, but not more than a single "values_to" argument. 

I would like to be able to pivot wide summary stats long like this...

```
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(contains("length"),
        list(mean = mean, sd = sd, min = min, max = max), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
      pivot_longer(names_to = "penguin_bits", values_to = c("mean", "sd", "max", "min"), 1:8, values_sep = "_")
      
```
  
... but not sure if that is possible.
