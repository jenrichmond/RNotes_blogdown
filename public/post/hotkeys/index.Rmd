There are some commands that as I get more and more familiar with Rstudio I find myself typing again and again. 



Keyboard shortcuts are helpful (disclaimer: these mac versions).

1. Option-Command-i will open a new Rmarkdown code chunk. 

2. Option - is a handy way of typing assignment (<-)

3. Shift-Command-M is a fast way of adding a pipe (%>%)

A little googling and here is a [whole list](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts) that I am yet to learn.
