Here are some ggplot tricks that I shared at the R-Ladies Sydney June Show and Tell. 

# Why is my internet speed so terrible?

Working from home and pivoting to teaching online has made me realise that my wifi connection is really bad, particularly when it rains. I have been teaching new honours students R and needed a little dataset to demo how to get data into R, so made a google form and put it out on twitter to confirm to myself that my connection really is worse than most other people. You can contribute to the [data here](www.tinyurl.com/howcrappyisyourinternet). 


# Packages for reading data into R

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # includes readr for .csv files
library(readxl) #for excel files
library(googlesheets4) #read straight from google sheets
library(datapasta) # for pasting data into R
library(janitor) # quick name cleaning

```


#### 1. read csv or xlsx

The standard way to get data into R is to read a file that you have downloaded. 

Read a .csv file

```{r eval = FALSE}
speed1 <- read_csv("crappy_internet.csv")

```

Read an excel file
```{r eval = FALSE}
 speed2 <- read_excel("crappy_internet.xlsx")
```


#### 2. direct from google docs

But the `googlesheets4` package allows you to authenticate your google account and read data straight from from googlesheets using only the url. More info here https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

speed3 <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yyl4fNMErNQ5mQaYgc2ELF7zF6cEPcfRNUtWr56nkg8/edit#gid=552570759") %>%
  clean_names()

```

#### 3. datapasta

Alternatively, you can copy and "paste" the data into R using the datapasta package. Find the [vignette here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datapasta/vignettes/how-to-datapasta.html)

```{r eval=FALSE}

speed4 <- # select your data and do Ctrl-C, put your cursor here, and choose Addins, paste as dataframe, and then run the chunk

```



# Packages for plotting

```{r}
library(ggbeeswarm) # add noise to point plots
library(ggeasy) # easy wrappers for difficult to remember ggplot things
library(papaja) # this is mostly a package for writing APA formatted manuscripts, but it also includes a ggplot theme that is nice
```


### First make the data long
```{r}
speedlong <- speed3 %>%
  select(where_do_you_live, is_it_raining, ends_with("speed")) %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "updown", values_to = "speed", download_speed:upload_speed)
```

### Plot up and download speeds. 

There is 1 lucky person in the dataset who apparently has download speeds of > 150 mb/s, just filtering them out of each plot. 

#### 1. geom_point()
```{r pointplot}
speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) 
```

This plot is ok, but all the points are on top of each other. 
Use the ggbeeswarm package to add a little noise. 

#### 2. geom_beeswarm()
```{r ggbeeswarm}
speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed)) +
  geom_beeswarm(size = 3) 
```
Beeswarm is better but I'd like more noise. 

#### 3. geom_quasirandom()
```{r quasirandom}
speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed)) +
  geom_quasirandom(width = 0.2, size = 3)
```

Now I want to know which of these points were collected when it was raining. 

#### 4. colouring the points

```{r colourrain}
speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed, colour = is_it_raining)) +
  geom_quasirandom(width = 0.2, size = 3)
```

#### 5. facet_wrap()
```{r facet-rain}
speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed, colour = is_it_raining)) +
  geom_quasirandom(width = 0.2, size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~ is_it_raining)
```

## Making ggplot easy

Now this version has lots of duplicated information. We probably don’t need the legend. How to remove the legend is something I have to google EVERY TIME. The ggplot solution is `+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())` — hard to remember

#### 6. easily remove the legend
```{r easynolegend}

speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed, colour = is_it_raining)) +
  geom_quasirandom(width = 0.2, size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~ is_it_raining) +
  easy_remove_legend() 
```

#### 7. fix the formatting

I really dislike the grey default of ggplot. Use theme_apa() to get nice formatting
```{r apa-plot}

speedlong %>%
  filter(speed < 100) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = updown, y = speed, colour = is_it_raining)) +
  geom_quasirandom(width = 0.2, size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~ is_it_raining) +
  theme_apa() + 
  easy_remove_legend() 
```


## Getting plots out of ggplot

#### Option 1: ggsave()

Put ggsave("nameofplot.png") at the end of each chunk and it will export the most recent plot. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggsave("testplot.png")

```

#### Option 2: RMarkdown magic

Use fig.path in your RMarkdown setup chunk (the one that looks like this at the top of your .Rmd) to export all your plots to a figures folder.

This is where chunk labels are important. If your chunks are not labelled the exported files will be called "unnamed-chunk-somenumber.png" BUT if you label the chunk the file name of the exported plot will be meaningful.
