There are a lot of things I do in R that I have to good EVERY TIME. My R resolution is to try and google less, to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. 

Up first... factors. 

# 1. convert to factor

I use read_csv to read data into R and it most conservatively assumes that when you have text in a variable you are dealing characters (not factors). Of course these things are often factors so you need to explicitly convert variables to factors. 

The forcats package will do this with `as_factor` 

### create a little df

```{r}
df <- data.frame("pp_no" = 1:8, 
                "Age" = c(21, 15, 23, 19, 19, 23, 24, 26), "group" = c("control","experimental"), "condition" = c("easy", "easy", "difficult", "difficult"),
                "score" = c(82, 55, 76, 31, 66, 89, 43, 67))
```
