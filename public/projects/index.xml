      <description>I have set myself a challenge of learning to deal with dates in R. Nothing like setting a date for an R-Ladies Sydney event where you will teach other people to spur the motivation for learning how to use the lubridate package.
The plan is to learn how to use the package and document my learning process along the way so that at the end of Oct I can tell everyone…</description>

      <description>Option 1: use mutate() and case_when() Option 2a: use mutate() and recode() dplyr “scoped” verbs (_all, _at, _if) Option 2b: use mutate_at() and recode()   I don’t often deal with questionnaire data in R, but Ariana and I have started trying import her qualtrics data into R and to write a script to score her measures. The first step is to recode the variables to make it possible to add up scores on subscales.</description>

      <description>count distinct values counting by levels   Sometimes things that are really easy to do in excel are not so intuitive in R. Like counting things. Because most of the time I am working with data in long format, you can end up with hundreds of observations, so functions like length() aren’t useful. Today I just wanted to check how many participants were in this dataset and it took me some significant googling.</description>

      <description>My 2020 Resolution There are a lot of things I do in R that I have to google EVERY TIME. My 2020 R resolution is to try and google less. I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesn’t stick, I can always just google my own blog.</description>

      <description>use as_factor() use levels() use fct_relevel()   I use read_csv to read data into R and it most conservatively assumes that when you have text in a variable you are dealing characters (not factors). Of course these things are often factors so you need to explicitly convert them if you want to use the factor in an analysis or have it appear the way you want in a ggplot.</description>
