      <description>My 2020 Resolution There are a lot of things I do in R that I have to google EVERY TIME. My 2020 R resolution is to try and google less. I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesnâ€™t stick, I can always just google my own blog.</description>
