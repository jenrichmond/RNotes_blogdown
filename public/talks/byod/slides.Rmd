A package is a group functions that some kind person has written, tested, bundled together and given away for everyone to use.

To install packages, type into your console. Just do this once.

To use a package, load it using the `library()` function. You need to do this every time you want to use the functions in a package.

library(tidyverse)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Step 1. In your console, install the following packages...

Step 2. Then open the Rmd_demo_babynames.Rmd file and find the grey "chunk" that has  `library(tidyverse)` in it. Add these below to load the following packages. 

```
library(janitor) 
library(here)
library(beepr)

Run the code in the chunk using the little green arrow on the right

# An aside about RMarkdown

.pull-left[

RMarkdown documents (or .Rmd files) are key to reproducible analysis. 
- notes/explanations + "chunks" of R code 
- "knit" the document (notes + code + output) into a nice format that other people (who may not know R) can access. 

### Tricks and tips

- Insert a chunk using shortcut Alt-Cmd-I
- Hash to get levels of heading
- Asterisks to get bold and italics

The `here` package will help avoid file path drama. You can use it to tell R where you data is, relative to the top level of your project folder.

We can use the `read_csv()` from `readr` and `here()` to read a .csv file.

## clean_names() from `janitor` 


### Problem 1: all of the variable names are weird and inconsistent

```
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
               clean_names()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/janitor_clean_names.png")
``` 

---

## rename() from `dplyr`

### Problem 2: you regret your variable names 

```
betterdata <- yourdata %>%
  rename(newname1 = oldname1, newname2 = oldname2)
  
```
<br>


<br>

> NOTE: I can never remember the order of the names in this function. 
Is it old = new? or new = old? 
I have resorted to a stupid mnemonic... it happens to be alphabetical (i.e. L-M-New = Old) 

---

## select() from `dplyr`

### Problem 3: you don't need all of those variables

Keep just the columns you name

``` 
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
  select(age, gender, score) 
```
Keep columns 1 thru 5, and 8 thru 12

```
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
  select(1:5, 8:12)

```

Use - to drop named variable, keeping everything else

```
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
  select(-date) 

```
---

class: inverse

# Your turn 7: Clean up your own data

Use clean_names() if your variable names are weird

```
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
               clean_names()
```


Use select() to pare down to just the variables you need 

``` 
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
  select(age, gender, score) 

```
Use rename() to give your variables more useful names 

```
better_data_in_R <- your_data_in_R %>%
  rename(newname1 = oldname1)
  
```

##  Your data is clean-er, but is it "tidy"? 

## Three rules for tidy data:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

# The grammar of graphics 

### ggplot wants to know 3 things
1. what data you want to plot
2. the "aesthetics" i.e. which variables you want on the x and y, what things look like (colour/shape/fill)
3. which "geom" you want to use (point, line, col, histogram, violin)

```
ggplot(data, aes(x = __, y = __)) +
  geom_point()
```
#### WATCH OUT! You can pipe data into ggplot (and combine with dplyr functions) but within ggplot you need to ADD LAYERS with +



```
data %>%
  filter(interesting_variable > z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = __, y = __)) +
  geom_point()
