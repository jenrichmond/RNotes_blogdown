      <description>I have set myself a challenge of learning to deal with dates in R. Nothing like setting a date for an R-Ladies Sydney event where you will teach other people to spur the motivation for learning how to use the lubridate package.
The plan is to learn how to use the package and document my learning process along the way so that at the end of Oct I can tell everyone…</description>

      <description>Some students have been asking me how they can calcuate means and standard errors by condition. Here is a quick example using the palmer penguin data.
Details of the palmer penguin data, with art by Allison Horst, can be found here.

      <description>The scale() function will center and/or scale a numeric object. Use center = TRUE to subtract the mean from the values; use scale = TRUE to divide the centered values by the standard deviation to produce z scores.
center variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
  generate z-scores for variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

      <description>Here are some ggplot tricks that I shared at the R-Ladies Sydney June Show and Tell.
Why is my internet speed so terrible? Working from home and pivoting to teaching online has made me realise that my wifi connection is really bad, particularly when it rains. I have been teaching new honours students R and needed a little dataset to demo how to get data into R, so made a google form and put it out on twitter to confirm to myself that my connection really is worse than most other people.</description>

      <description>There is no doubt that COVID19 has massively disrupted how we spend our time and money. In this post, I update code inspired by this R-bloggers blog to look at how much less money we have been spending on eating in the last month, compared to April 2019.

The first step is to recode the variables to make it possible to add up scores on subscales.</description>

      <description>count distinct values counting by levels   Sometimes things that are really easy to do in excel are not so intuitive in R. Like counting things. Because most of the time I am working with data in long format, you can end up with hundreds of observations, so functions like length() aren’t useful. Today I just wanted to check how many participants were in this dataset and it took me some significant googling.</description>

I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesn’t stick, I can always just google my own blog.</description>

      <description>use as_factor() use levels() use fct_relevel()   I use read_csv to read data into R and it most conservatively assumes that when you have text in a variable you are dealing characters (not factors). Of course these things are often factors so you need to explicitly convert them if you want to use the factor in an analysis or have it appear the way you want in a ggplot.</description>

      <description>I started a blog post and pushed it to the git repo that contains my blog. Charles forked my repo, cloned it to her machine, contributed to the post, and then pushed the updates to her forked copy of the repo.
Then she did a pull request. People in git-land talk about PRs (pull requests) all the time, and the term seems backwards to me. A pull request is when you request that the owner of a repo “pull” the changes that you have made.</description>

      <description>I have been a git user for 513 days.
When I was first setting up this blog, my dear friend Charles T Gray helped me learn the 3 terminal commands that you need to know to interact with git in the most rudimentary of ways.
 git add .
  git commit -m “something meaningful”
  git push
 Since then I have mostly just used these 3 commands to push blog posts to git.</description>

      <description>I had the pleasure of attending Alison Hill’s RMarkdown workshop in Canberra on Monday and I came away with so many tips and tricks! It was brillant.
Alison covered A LOT over the course of the day. I learned lots of the power of yaml, how to create parameterised reports, and how to make a package that contains customised .Rmd templates. Each of those topics are blogposts for another day, but my favourite bit was making a beautiful Academic theme blogdown site.</description>

      <description>Cute #rstats monster art by the amazing Allison Horst.
I have been using gather() and spread() a lot lately. I’m on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.
For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants.</description>

      <description>There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.
Alison Hill I used Alison’s blog post when I first set up this blog. It looks like she has updated the post recently, so it is probably still a good place to start.</description>

the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor</description>

 Everything will be just fine as long as you keep your datafiles in the same folder as your .rmd file

      <description>This content has appeared before in a dirty data post, but I still find myself googling these functions. So they deserve a post of their own. The tidyr package has several functions that allow you to reshape your data. They are surprisely useful; I have found myself gathering a lot, mostly to get data from &amp;ldquo;SPSS format&amp;rdquo; into something that ggplot will handle. I have also discovered the flexibility with which you can spread the data on a particular variable, do a set of computations, and then gather it back for plotting&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.</description>

      <description>It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003
So here is an excellent approach to data wrangling in #rstats https://t.</description>

      <description>I am a developmental psychologist in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. My research investigates age-related changes in learning, memory, and emotion understanding in infants and preschoolers. Babies and kids tend not to tell you what they remember or understand, so we use method like eyetracking and psychophysiology to record subtle changes in their behaviour. These methods produce a LOT of data.
This blog is a record of my R learning journey as I venture into new data wrangling and analysis approaches.</description>

      <description>I was trying to work out how to do t-tests using my own data and the lsr package but ended up working with Dani’s AFL data from her book while trying to work out why R insisted that my outcome variable wasn’t numeric (it definitely was). Turns out that the lsr package doesn’t deal well with tibbles (which are created by default when you use read_csv to get your data) but if you use read.</description>

      <description>I am feeling more confident about my resolution to get rid of Excel and only use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Next steps&amp;hellip; analysis.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&amp;rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).</description>

      <description>The frequency with which my data is missing important information when it gets to R is a bit embarrassing. I&amp;rsquo;m sure as I learn what kind of information R needs I&amp;rsquo;ll get better at this but for the moment using functions like rep() to create variables like trial number or block has been super useful.
Alison Smith has a great blog called Very Statisticious and her post about simulating data is super helpful.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing lots of data wrangling recently and decided a needed a quick rundown of data cleaning in R. Turns out www.DataCamp.com has a course called exactly that. Here are notes on useful things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day&amp;hellip; another data set. This time I am trying to get EMG data from LabChart into R. LabChart is the software we use to record EMG data and do the first steps of data cleaning/processing. At the moment a good chunk of the cleaning process involves Excel macros, so my goal is to replicate what we have traditionally done in Excel in R, so that it is more automated and more reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been travelling for the last few weeks, first to a teaching conference at Duke called PsychOne, and then to the International Congress on Infant Studies (ICIS) in Philadelphia. There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What a treat it was to finally meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cantabile&#34;&gt;Charles Gray&lt;/a&gt; when she was in Sydney last week. She ran her R-Curious workshop for us and I picked up so many useful markdown tips.&lt;/p&gt;
