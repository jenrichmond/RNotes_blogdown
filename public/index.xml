      <description>Thanks to Tom Mock for saving me from this blogpost on twitter. I was monster number 6… beginning to convince myself that there were gremlins in the across() function.
In fact, I had forgotten the golden rule:
 don’t make objects that have the same names a functions
 That is for another post…
the across() function I have been playing with the new across() function in dplyr which is a magical solution when you are looking to get several summary statistics across a range of variables.</description>

      <description>There are so many lovely packages for colour palettes (see links at the bottom of this post for more).
This new one called feather by Shandiya Balasubramanium is inspired by Australian birds and is delightful.
Today I built my first R package! Meet feather: a set of colour palettes inspired by the plumage of Australian birds. It&#39;s a work in progress and a bit rough around the edges, but I&#39;m pretty proud of it#RStats #WildOz #DataVisualization https://t.</description>

      <description>Last year my R resolution was to google less. I think I succeeded (kinda). I wrote a few posts in my IDHTG series.
counting things recoding variable work with factors annotating plots use colour palettes  I don’t necessary remember exactly how to recode variables or to make factors behave, but I know I have notes in my blog about those things to refer to, so that makes the googling much faster.</description>

      <description>The janitor package by Sam Firke contains probably my FAVOURITE R function: clean_names(). By default when I am reading data into R, I pipe clean_names() onto the end of my read_csv(). I never have to look at inconsistently formatted variable names. But janitor package includes lots of other useful functions that make it easier to deal with dirty data and count stuff.
new_df &amp;lt;- read_csv(here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;df.csv&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% clean_names())  Exploring package functions Are you keen to dig into the little known functions of a package that you use all the time?</description>

      <description>If I had a dollar for everytime I have googled how to change the colours in my ggplot&amp;hellip;it is clearly time for a &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to google&amp;rdquo; post about it.
library(tidyverse) library(palmerpenguins) library(RColorBrewer) library(harrypotter) penguins &amp;lt;- penguins make a couple of basic plots When dealing with geom_point(), you can use colour to change the colour of the points. For geom_col(), you need to use fill; colour will change the border around your bars.</description>

      <description>A new post in my I Don&amp;rsquo;t Have to Google (IDHTG) series. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to work out how to add annotations to plots for a while and this plot from the @WeAreRladies account this week got me inspired!
I also looked at activity by week. You can see that there are some weeks when there was a break between curators. You can also see curators are totally different - both in terms of number of tweets and the number of retweets and replies.</description>

      <description>Art by Allison Horst @allison_horst
 So far I have learned that lubridate has some nice functions for pulling date components like day, month, or year and using them within group_by() and summarise() or ggplot(). But most of the time when I am working with date data in the real world, R doesn&amp;rsquo;t even think my dates are dates. Most of the time date data that I read into R gets parsed as characters.</description>

      <description>Art by Allison Horst @allison_horst
 When I am trying to work out a problem with R, I generally skip the package documentation, I avoid stack overflow, and I go straight for a blog post written by someone who has just learned what I am trying to learn.
I think when you have just learned something, you are in THE BEST PLACE to teach someone else. You are acutely aware of what it feels like to not &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The scale() function will center and/or scale a numeric object. Use center = TRUE to subtract the mean from the values; use scale = TRUE to divide the centered values by the standard deviation to produce z scores.
center variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
 generate z-scores for variable A  scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

      <description>Here are some ggplot tricks that I shared at the R-Ladies Sydney June Show and Tell.
Why is my internet speed so terrible? Working from home and pivoting to teaching online has made me realise that my wifi connection is really bad, particularly when it rains. I have been teaching new honours students R and needed a little dataset to demo how to get data into R, so made a google form and put it out on twitter to confirm to myself that my connection really is worse than most other people.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t often deal with questionnaire data in R, but Ariana and I have started trying import her qualtrics data into R and to write a script to score her measures. The first step is to recode the variables to make it possible to add up scores on subscales.
load packages library(tidyverse) make a little dataframe df &amp;lt;- data.frame(&amp;#34;pp_no&amp;#34; = 1:12, &amp;#34;sectionA_1&amp;#34; = c(&amp;#34;Strongly Agree&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Agree&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Disagree&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Strongly Disagree&amp;#34;), &amp;#34;sectionA_2&amp;#34; = c(&amp;#34;Strongly Agree&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Agree&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Disagree&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Strongly Disagree&amp;#34;), &amp;#34;sectionB_1&amp;#34; = c(&amp;#34;Frequently&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Sometimes&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Infrequently&amp;#34;), &amp;#34;sectionB_2&amp;#34; = c(&amp;#34;Frequently&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Sometimes&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Infrequently&amp;#34;)) Option 1: use mutate() and case_when() My first intuition is to use case_when(), which I have written about before.</description>

      <description>Sometimes things that are really easy to do in excel are not so intuitive in R. Like counting things. Because most of the time I am working with data in long format, you can end up with hundreds of observations, so functions like length() aren&amp;rsquo;t useful. Today I just wanted to check how many participants were in this dataset and it took me some significant googling.

      <description>I use read_csv to read data into R and it most conservatively assumes that when you have text in a variable you are dealing characters (not factors). Of course these things are often factors so you need to explicitly convert them if you want to use the factor in an analysis or have it appear the way you want in a ggplot.
The forcats package will do this with as_factor</description>

      <description>I started a blog post and pushed it to the git repo that contains my blog. Charles forked my repo, cloned it to her machine, contributed to the post, and then pushed the updates to her forked copy of the repo.
Then she did a pull request. People in git-land talk about PRs (pull requests) all the time, and the term seems backwards to me. A pull request is when you request that the owner of a repo &amp;ldquo;pull&amp;rdquo; the changes that you have made.</description>

When I was first setting up this blog, my dear friend Charles T Gray helped me learn the 3 terminal commands that you need to know to interact with git in the most rudimentary of ways.
 git add .
  git commit -m “something meaningful”

Alison covered A LOT over the course of the day. I learned lots of the power of yaml, how to create parameterised reports, and how to make a package that contains customised .Rmd templates. Each of those topics are blogposts for another day, but my favourite bit was making a beautiful Academic theme blogdown site.</description>

      <description>Cute #rstats monster art by the amazing Allison Horst.
I have been using gather() and spread() a lot lately. I’m on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.
For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants.</description>

      <description>As I write my first paper reporting data analysis coming out of R (woot!!!), here are some notes summarising all the googling I have done this morning about how to produce APA style figures in ggplot.
  via GIPHY Load libraries Start by loading tidyverse to get ggplot, here to make finding the data easy, and papaja to get the theme_apa() function.

      <description>There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.

      <description>I’ve been analysing some future thinking data and playing around with packages that can do repeated ANOVA (I know, I should do LMM). There is more than one way to skin a cat and the differences come down to two things.
the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor</description>

      <description>I love me a good #rstats screencast. David Robinson has been screencasting his #TidyTuesday efforts for the past few months and while it is GREAT to watch a master at work, I just don’t have time to watch someone code for an hour, in order to extract a handful of tips.
So when I saw Nick Tierney tweet about posting short videos that contain Just Three Things, I thought “that is a GREAT idea”.</description>

      <description>How would we learn R if not for google? Here are some things I googled this week (and mostly not for the first time).
1. how to install a package from github. 95% of the time, packages I want are on CRAN and I can just use the install.packages function to install them.
install.packages(&amp;quot;nameofthepackage&amp;quot;)  Occasionally though, I see something cool and new on Twitter and need to install from github.</description>

      <description>Learning new things is HARD. Stats methods are particularly hard because it not just about running the test. You have to…
 learn when to run the test learn how to run the test learn how to interpret the test AND learn how to write about the results of the test  Part of what makes this learning hard is that our research methods training has drummed into us that there is a RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.</description>

      <description>When we want to learn how to do something new in R, we all start by googling it. Having worked out simple ANOVA, next on my list is repeated measures.
Domnique Makowski has an excellent blog post that comes up at the top of the search results when you google “how to do repeated measures ANOVA in R”.
He lures you in with a post that seems like it is going to solve all your problems and then and BAM… starts the post by saying “DON’T do it”.</description>

      <description>As I add new projects to my rstats portfolio and work collaboratively on projects with students the issue of working directories is becoming more and more complicated. Not really understanding how working directories and file paths actually work, I have been relying on the beginner logic…
 Everything will be just fine as long as you keep your datafiles in the same folder as your .rmd file
   via GIPHY I aspire to have organized folders that Jen Thompson would be proud of, but that is going involve getting my head around directories.</description>

      <description>This content has appeared before in a dirty data post, but I still find myself googling these functions. So they deserve a post of their own. The tidyr package has several functions that allow you to reshape your data. They are surprisely useful; I have found myself gathering a lot, mostly to get data from &amp;ldquo;SPSS format&amp;rdquo; into something that ggplot will handle. I have also discovered the flexibility with which you can spread the data on a particular variable, do a set of computations, and then gather it back for plotting&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.</description>

      <description>It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003

      <description>I am a developmental psychologist in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. My research investigates age-related changes in learning, memory, and emotion understanding in infants and preschoolers. Babies and kids tend not to tell you what they remember or understand, so we use method like eyetracking and psychophysiology to record subtle changes in their behaviour. These methods produce a LOT of data.

I&amp;rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&amp;rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m sure as I learn what kind of information R needs I&amp;rsquo;ll get better at this but for the moment using functions like rep() to create variables like trial number or block has been super useful.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.</description>
