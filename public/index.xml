      <description>Thanks to Tom Mock for saving me from this blogpost on twitter. I was monster number 6… beginning to convince myself that there were gremlins in the across() function.
In fact, I had forgotten the golden rule:
 don’t make objects that have the same names a functions
 That is for another post…
the across() function I have been playing with the new across() function in dplyr which is a magical solution when you are looking to get several summary statistics across a range of variables.</description>

      <description>There are so many lovely packages for colour palettes (see links at the bottom of this post for more).
This new one called feather by Shandiya Balasubramanium is inspired by Australian birds and is delightful.
Today I built my first R package! Meet feather: a set of colour palettes inspired by the plumage of Australian birds. It&#39;s a work in progress and a bit rough around the edges, but I&#39;m pretty proud of it#RStats #WildOz #DataVisualization https://t.</description>

      <description>Last year my R resolution was to google less. I think I succeeded (kinda). I wrote a few posts in my IDHTG series.
counting things recoding variable work with factors annotating plots use colour palettes  I don’t necessary remember exactly how to recode variables or to make factors behave, but I know I have notes in my blog about those things to refer to, so that makes the googling much faster.</description>

      <description>My 2020 Resolution There are a lot of things I do in R that I have to google EVERY TIME. My 2020 R resolution is to try and google less. I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesn’t stick, I can always just google my own blog.</description>

      <description>I have been a git user for 513 days.
When I was first setting up this blog, my dear friend Charles T Gray helped me learn the 3 terminal commands that you need to know to interact with git in the most rudimentary of ways.
 git add .
  git commit -m “something meaningful”
  git push
 Since then I have mostly just used these 3 commands to push blog posts to git.</description>

      <description>I had the pleasure of attending Alison Hill’s RMarkdown workshop in Canberra on Monday and I came away with so many tips and tricks! It was brillant.
Alison covered A LOT over the course of the day. I learned lots of the power of yaml, how to create parameterised reports, and how to make a package that contains customised .Rmd templates. Each of those topics are blogposts for another day, but my favourite bit was making a beautiful Academic theme blogdown site.</description>

      <description>Cute #rstats monster art by the amazing Allison Horst.
I have been using gather() and spread() a lot lately. I’m on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.
For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants.</description>

I’m going going to talk about my favourite option (which is the memery package), but here is what I learned about other packages.
Option 1: memer The memer package by Sam Tyner is a tidyverse compatible package that allows you to replace text in popular memes with your own.</description>

      <description>There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.

      <description>I’ve been analysing some future thinking data and playing around with packages that can do repeated ANOVA (I know, I should do LMM). There is more than one way to skin a cat and the differences come down to two things.
the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor</description>

      <description>I love me a good #rstats screencast. David Robinson has been screencasting his #TidyTuesday efforts for the past few months and while it is GREAT to watch a master at work, I just don’t have time to watch someone code for an hour, in order to extract a handful of tips.
So when I saw Nick Tierney tweet about posting short videos that contain Just Three Things, I thought “that is a GREAT idea”.</description>

TIL that you can have a live preview of your #rstats Markdown docs!
Just use the infinite_moon_reader function from the xaringan package.
It works for all single-HTML-file outputs and even comes with a pre-made RStudio Addin! — Jozef Hajnala (@jozefhajnala) January 2, 2019   When Charles was visiting for #RCurious in June, she had written her slides in xaringan and was raving about infinite moon reader.</description>

      <description>Sometimes your plot needs a celebratory gif.

Just so I’ll remember for next time, here is a step by step how to…
how to add a gif to your ggplot Install the magick package and load it with ggplot. Install and load the beepr package too so you can have RStudio beep at you when it has finished rendering your gif (it can take a long time).</description>

      <description>How would we learn R if not for google? Here are some things I googled this week (and mostly not for the first time).
1. how to install a package from github. 95% of the time, packages I want are on CRAN and I can just use the install.packages function to install them.
install.packages(&amp;quot;nameofthepackage&amp;quot;)  Occasionally though, I see something cool and new on Twitter and need to install from github.</description>

      <description>Learning new things is HARD. Stats methods are particularly hard because it not just about running the test. You have to…
 learn when to run the test learn how to run the test learn how to interpret the test AND learn how to write about the results of the test  Part of what makes this learning hard is that our research methods training has drummed into us that there is a RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.</description>

      <description>When we want to learn how to do something new in R, we all start by googling it. Having worked out simple ANOVA, next on my list is repeated measures.
Domnique Makowski has an excellent blog post that comes up at the top of the search results when you google “how to do repeated measures ANOVA in R”.
He lures you in with a post that seems like it is going to solve all your problems and then and BAM… starts the post by saying “DON’T do it”.</description>

      <description>As I add new projects to my rstats portfolio and work collaboratively on projects with students the issue of working directories is becoming more and more complicated. Not really understanding how working directories and file paths actually work, I have been relying on the beginner logic…
 Everything will be just fine as long as you keep your datafiles in the same folder as your .rmd file
   via GIPHY I aspire to have organized folders that Jen Thompson would be proud of, but that is going involve getting my head around directories.</description>

      <description>I am a developmental psychologist in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. My research investigates age-related changes in learning, memory, and emotion understanding in infants and preschoolers. Babies and kids tend not to tell you what they remember or understand, so we use method like eyetracking and psychophysiology to record subtle changes in their behaviour. These methods produce a LOT of data.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.</description>

      <description>I have been travelling for the last few weeks, first to a teaching conference at Duke called PsychOne, and then to the International Congress on Infant Studies (ICIS) in Philadelphia. There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn’t get to go to).</description>

      <description>What a treat it was to finally meet Charles Gray when she was in Sydney last week. She ran her R-Curious workshop for us and I picked up so many useful markdown tips.
We worked from an Rmarkdown document in the workshop so we could edit the code and add our own notes but we could also how Charles had used specific markdown formatting to produce the document.</description>
