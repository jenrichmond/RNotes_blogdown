<p>I saw an intriguing tweet this afternoon.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
üßô ‚ôÇÔ∏èLive preview for R Markdown!<br><br>TIL that you can have a live preview of your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> Markdown docs!<br>Just use the infinite_moon_reader function from the xaringan package.<br>It works for all single-HTML-file outputs and even comes with a pre-made RStudio Addin!

<p>When <a href="@cantabile">Charles</a> was visiting for #RCurious in June, she had written her slides in <code>xarigan</code> and was raving about infinite moon reader. I assumed it was something far too fancy for us Curious types. But this tweet has me interested.</p>
<p>Is this infinite moon reader thing magical or all hype? What does it mean by live preview? Maybe I don‚Äôt have to <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> in order to see updates on my post.</p>

<h3>How to use infinite moon reader</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: here I am talking about blogging etc, not about xarigan slides (which is definitely on my 2019 to learn list)</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="step-1." class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1.</h4>
<p>Install the xarigan package and load it.</p>
<pre><code>install_packages(&quot;xarigan&quot;)
library(xarigan)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-2." class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2.</h4>
<p>Open a rmd document that you are working on and in the console call <code>xarigan::inf_mr()</code> i.e.¬†infinite moon reader.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3." class="section level4">
<h4>Step 3.</h4>
<p>Write something and use Ctrl/Command-S to save it. Your document will update automatically in the Viewer pane.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="whats-the-big-deal" class="section level3">
<h3>What‚Äôs the big deal?</h3>
<p>Doesn‚Äôt <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> do that anyway?</p>
<p>Yes, when you are working in blogdown and save, it runs <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> and updates the Viewer pane. But that is not true of all markdown instances. In <code>radix</code> or when you are just doing an analysis in a markdown document, knitting the file can be slow.</p>
<p>By having <code>xarigan::inf_mr()</code> running in the console, you can have the same functionality of <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> on all markdown documents. And you can use it in blogdown too, so you don‚Äôt need different knitting tricks for different situations.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-there-a-downside" class="section level3">
<h3>Is there a downside?</h3>
<p>While <code>inf_mr()</code> is occupying your console, it is out of action for other things. But as <a href="@cantabile">Charles</a> says, that might not be a bad thing, when you are actually trying to put words on the page.</p>
