It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).

Here is another [great wrangling resource](http://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_processing), this time by [Bradley Boehmke](@bradleyboehmke). 

And if you need a rationale for why it is a good idea to acquire some wrangling skills, a quote by [Jenny Bryan](@JennyBryan)

##### A few things I didn't already know about `tidyr` and `dplyr`

1. In addition to gather() and spread(), the `tidyr` package can also be used to separate() i.e. pull parts of a single variable apart into separate columns and unite() i.e. combine several columns into one. 

2. When using filter() from `dplyr`, specify group membership using %in%. Also distinct() will remove duplicate rows and slice(3:5) will subset by particular rows. 

3. When using `dplyr` summarise(), sometimes you want to count the number of participants but n() will give you the number of observations. There is an n_distinct() function that might be useful in counting the number of participants.
