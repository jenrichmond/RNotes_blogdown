Some students have been asking me how they can calcuate means and standard errors by condition. Here is a quick example using the palmer penguin data. 

Details of the palmer penguin data, with art by Allison Horst, can be [found here](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

![](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

### load packages


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins) 
library(tidyverse)

```
### read in data
```{r}

penguins <- penguins

glimpse(penguins)

```

### use group_by() and summarise() to get standard error by condition (aka species)
```{r}

penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            n = n(), 
            stdev = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            stderr = stdev/sqrt(n)) 
```
