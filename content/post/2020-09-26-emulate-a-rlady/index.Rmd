When I am trying to work out a problem with R, I generally skip the package documentation, I avoid stack overflow, and I go straight for a blog post written by someone who has just learned what I am trying to learn. 

I think when you have just learned something, you are in THE BEST PLACE to teach someone else. You are acutely aware of what it feels like to not "get it".  You have only very recently worked out the pinch points and stumbling blocks, so you are well positioned to write in a way that allows another beginner to avoid all that. 

In contrast, package documentation is written by the developer who knows WAY TOO MUCH about the intricacies of how it works under the hood to have much empathy for someone who knows nothing. And stack overflow is full of experts who suffer from the curse of knowledge and deliver base R solutions in a condescending tone.

When I found [Julia's Silge's post about lubridate](https://juliasilge.com/blog/lubridate-london-stage/) I was immediately excited because I knew that I could learn A LOT about how lubridate works by finding an interesting dataset and emulating her post. 


COVID cases have been really low in NSW in the last couple of weeks after a bit of a spike back in July-August, but the Chief Health Officer has been warning about not becoming complacent because testing rates have also been declining. 

[This data](https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data/tests) comes from NSW health and contains the number of tests conducted throughout NSW each day by age group during the pandemic. There should be date data to deal with. 

# load packages
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggeasy) # for easy ggplot editing
library(harrypotter) # for palettes
options(scipen = 999)
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

I usually ask .Rmd to not even show me these package loading messages by setting the chunk options to `warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE`, but this warning could be the source of some issues I have had with lubridate in the past. 

The lubridate package has a `here()` function that messes with the `here()` function from the `here` package. If you are going to use `lubridate` and `here` in the same analysis, you need to remember to use `here::here()` to avoid problems.

# read in the data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tests <- read_csv("testing_agg.csv")

```

# check data types

```{r}
glimpse(tests)
```

Nice! the date column is in date format, that doesn't always happen with my data in the wild.

Lets look at the first few rows of the dataframe.  Looks like we have test counts each day for separate age groups. I'm not interested in age at the moment, but I would like to know how testing rates have changed over the past few months. 

```{r}
head(tests)
```

Start by making a dataframe with getting the total tests conducted each day across age groups. 

```{r}
total_tests <- tests %>% 
  group_by(test_date) %>%
  summarise(test_count = sum(test_count))
```


# getting months/days

lubridate has functions that will pull the day, month or year from a variable in date format. Following in Julia's footsteps here.

```{r}

today() 

year(today())

month(today())

day(today())
```

Lets use the `month()` function to count how many tests have been conducted in each month since the beginning of the pandemic.

```{r}
total_tests %>% 
  group_by(month(test_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(month_tests = sum(test_count))

```

It looks like we really stepped up the testing in July and August but the NSW Chief Health Officer is right, September rates are really low. Lets plot that...use label = TRUE to include month names rather than numbers.

Make a new df that summarises the total tests conducted each month. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
month_summary <- total_tests %>% 
  group_by(month(test_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(total_tests = sum(test_count)) %>%
  rename(covid_month = 'month(test_date, label = TRUE)')

```

### plot total tests by month 

```{r}
month_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_month, y = total_tests, fill = covid_month)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_hp_d(option = "LunaLovegood") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 800000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Total number of COVID tests conducted in NSW \n each month", x = "Month", y = "Total tests", caption = "data downloaded from https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data (28-9-2020)") +
  theme_classic() +
  easy_remove_legend() 
```

Yikes September total tests are REALLY low, there is still a few days left but still...

The health officials are always talking about variability in the number of new cases might be related to when the tests are conducted. I wonder whether there is a pattern in the number of tests conducted across the week. `lubridate` has a `wday()` function that works a lot like `month()` to allow you to summarise by day of the week. 

Make a new df that summarises the mean number of tests conducted each day of the week. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wday_summary <- total_tests %>% 
  group_by(wday(test_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(mean_tests = mean(test_count)) %>%
  rename(covid_day = 'wday(test_date, label = TRUE)')

```

### plot mean tests each week day
```{r}
wday_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_day, y = mean_tests, fill = covid_day)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_hp_d(option = "HermioneGranger") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Mean number of COVID tests conducted in NSW \n each weekday", x = "Week day", y = "Total tests", caption = "data downloaded from https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data (28-9-2020)") +
  theme_classic() +
  easy_remove_legend()
```

Looks like testing rates decline across the working week, and are definitely much lower in the weekend. I wonder whether that pattern has changed across the pandemic. 

Make a new df that summarises the number of tests conducted by day of the week for each month. Use  `week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)` to make Monday the start of the week. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

wday_month_summary <- total_tests %>% 
  mutate(covid_day = wday(test_date,  week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1), label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(covid_month = month(test_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(covid_day, covid_month) %>%
  summarise(mean_tests = mean(test_count, na.rm = TRUE))


```

### plot mean tests each week day by month
```{r}
wday_month_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_day, y = mean_tests, fill = covid_day)) +
  geom_col() +
 scale_fill_hp_d(option = "DracoMalfoy") +
  facet_wrap(~covid_month) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 35000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Mean number of COVID tests conducted in NSW \n each week day across the pandemic", 
       x = "Week day", y = "Total tests", 
       caption = "data downloaded from https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data (28-9-2020)") +
  easy_remove_legend()
```

`geom_col()` makes it difficult to see how testing rates might have changed across the pandemic. Lets look at just July - September. 

### plot mean tests each week day July - Sept
```{r}
wday_month_summary %>%
  filter(covid_month %in% c("Jul", "Aug", "Sep")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_day, y = mean_tests, 
             colour = covid_month, group = covid_month)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
 scale_colour_hp_d(option = "RonWeasley") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 35000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Mean number of COVID tests conducted in NSW \n each weekday in the past 3 months", x = "Week day", y = "Mean tests", caption = "data downloaded from https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data (28-9-2020)") +
  theme_classic() +
 theme(
    legend.position = c(.98, .98),
    legend.justification = c("right", "top"),
    legend.box.just = "right",
    legend.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6)
    )
```

Interesting... looks like testing rates in Sept are the same as in Aug (but lower than July) early in the week, but fewer people are being tested as the week goes on.

### How many fewer tests are we doing each day in Sept relative to July levels?

Using the `day()` function instead of `wday()` to plot the tests each day across the month.  

```{r}
total_tests %>% 
  filter(month(test_date, label = TRUE) %in% c("Jul", "Aug", "Sep")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day(test_date), y = test_count, fill = wday(test_date, label = TRUE, week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)))) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~month(test_date, label = TRUE)) +
  scale_fill_hp_d(option = "LunaLovegood") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Daily COVID tests conducted in NSW in July-Sept", x = "Month", y = "Tests per day", caption = "data downloaded from https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data (28-9-2020)") +
  theme_classic() +
  easy_remove_legend_title()

```

Oh!!! 

The data I downloaded 28-9-2020 is incomplete. Even though the website says this data is updated every day, the total tests for Sept are bad because we only have data up until 11-9-2020. 

# What have I learned about lubridate thus far

- sometimes R automatically recognises your date variables as dates, but I'm not sure why this happens really infrequently with my real world data- probably related to d-m-y format not being the R default
  + how to make it more likely that R will read my dates as dates
  + how to convert dates that R thinks are characters into date format
  
- lubridate functions like `day()`, `w_day()`, `month()` and `year()`, make it easy to work with date components as ordinal factors
  + use `label = TRUE` when using these functions to use labels rather than numeric values
  + use `week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)` to change the default from the week starting on Sunday to starting on Monday
  
- lubridate still clashes with the here package; if you are using both you need to specify `here::here()`. Find out when lubridate will no longer have a `here()` function.
