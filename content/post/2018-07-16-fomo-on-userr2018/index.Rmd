I have been travelling for the last few weeks, first to a teaching conference at Duke called PsychOne, and then to the International Congress on Infant Studies (ICIS) in Philadelphia. There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn't get to go to).

I was really disappointed to hear that the biggest international R conference was scheduled to be in Australia while I was in the USA, and for the past week or so I have been experiencing serious fomo. I have been glued to twitter and feeling envious. BUT... because the R community is open and inclusive and amazing, all of the tutorials and keynotes have been recorded and uploaded to youtube.
