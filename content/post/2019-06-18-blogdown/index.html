<p>There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo “Academic theme”.</p>
<p>I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I’ve seen recently into one place.</p>

<h4>Alison Hill</h4>
<p>I used <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Alison’s blog post</a> when I first set up this blog. It looks like she has updated the post recently, so it is probably still a good place to start.</p>
<p>Since then Alison has also written a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">book about blogdown</a>, run a RStudioConf19 <a href="https://arm.rbind.io/">Advanced RMarkdown workshop</a>, done <a href="http:/rstd.io/blogdown-sdss">a talk at SDSS</a> and now works at RStudio. <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/">Her website</a> is a lovely example of the Academic theme and contains links all her talks/workshops/publications.</p>
<p>Most recently she has <a href="https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1138626886618083328">challenged her RStudio summer interns</a> to a <a href="https://summer-of-blogdown.netlify.com/">Summer of blogdown challenge</a>.</p>

<h4>Dan Quintana</h4>
<p>Dan did a <a href="https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1070392412445401088">Twitter live thing in 2018</a> showing how you could put the basic structure of an Academic website together within an hour.</p>
<p>He updated that recently in a <a href="https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1139846569623281664">new Twitter live</a> and supplemented it with a <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/">step by step blog post</a>.</p>
