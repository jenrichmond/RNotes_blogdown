I have been using `gather()` and `spread()` a lot lately. I'm on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.

For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 

loco <- read_csv("locoresp.csv")

head(loco, 10)
```

The raw response rates are interesting, but there is MASSIVE variability. Some mums are chatty-Kathy and others say almost nothing. Also some mums have no responses in one or more categories. 

It is helpful to express each type of response as a proportion of the total. That is hard to do because it involves row wise calculations for each participant. So instead, I have been spreading the data wide so that the count of each kind of response ends up in a different column, then calculating totals and proportions and then gathering the data long again. 

#### Here is how that works... 
This chunk makes a new df called loco_wide by taking the loco df, ditching the old numbered resp_type variable then spreading the new wordy resptypes across columns. 

Using `na_replace()` from the `narniar` package, all the NAs are replaced with 0.  Then use `mutate()` to make a new total column that adds affirmative + descriptive + action-directed responses, and makes three new proportion columns. Then select just pp columns and the new proportion variables. 

```{r}

spread_loco_wide <- loco %>%
  select(-resp_type) %>%
  spread(key = resptype, value = count) %>% replace_na(list(affirmative = 0, descriptive = 0, action_directed = 0)) %>%
  mutate(total = affirmative + descriptive + action_directed) %>%
   mutate(prop_aff = affirmative/total, 
         prop_desc = descriptive/total, 
         prop_action = action_directed/total) %>%
  select(pp_no:loco_stats, starts_with("prop"))

head(spread_loco_wide, 3)
```

This chunk takes loco_wide, selects just pp info and the new proportion columns and gathers them long again, arranging by pp_no. 
```{r}
gather_loco_long <- spread_loco_wide %>%
  gather(key = resptype, value = proportion, prop_aff:prop_action) %>%
  arrange(pp_no)

head(gather_loco_long, 3)
```

There are so many helpful resources online that people have put together to help beginners get their head around what these functions are doing. These animations by [Garrick Aden-Buie](@grrrck)  are awesome.

BUT every time I want to do it, I find myself looking up [these notes](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/gather-spread-unite-separate/) I made myself last year. 

I don't seem to be able to just remember the arguments that `gather()` and `spread()` need. Reassuringly, I'm not the only one and Hadley Wickham has recently [done something about it](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html), writing new functions to replace gather and spread. 

## Pivot wider and longer

NOTE: these functions are not yet on CRAN and to use them you need to install the development version from github. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

The new functions are called `pivot_longer()` (which replaces gather) and `pivot_wider()` (which replaces spread).

Lets try them out to make the loco data wide. For `pivot_wider()`, we need to know the df that we want to make wide, names_from = the column that contains the names to spread, values_from = the dv that you want to spread across columns. 

> df %>% pivot_wider(names_from = , values_from = )

```{r}
#make data wide
pivot_loco_wide <- loco %>% 
  select(-resp_type) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = resptype, values_from = count) 

#get rid of NA, add extra columns
pivot_loco_wide <- pivot_loco_wide%>%
  replace_na(list(affirmative = 0, descriptive = 0, action_directed = 0)) %>%
  mutate(total = affirmative + descriptive + action_directed) %>%
   mutate(prop_aff = affirmative/total, 
         prop_desc = descriptive/total, 
         prop_action = action_directed/total) %>%
  select(pp_no:loco_stats, starts_with("prop")) 

head(pivot_loco_wide, 10)
```
Awesome, now we can make the loco_wide data long...

The structure of `pivot_longer()` is the same but you tell it which columns to gather. Then the names_to = is the name of the column that will contain the names, and values_to =  the name of the column with values in it. 

Note for `pivot_longer()` but not `pivot_wider()`, you need to put the name of the names and values column in quotes. Presumably thats because those columns don't exist yet?

> df %>%
 pivot_longer(colsto:makelong, names_to = "namescol", values_to = "valuecol")
 
```{r}
pivot_loco_long <- pivot_loco_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(prop_aff:prop_action, names_to = "resp", values_to = "proportion") %>%
  arrange(pp_no)

head(pivot_loco_long, 10)
```

I think they are more intuitive, but we will see how long it takes me to not need to refer back to these notes :)
