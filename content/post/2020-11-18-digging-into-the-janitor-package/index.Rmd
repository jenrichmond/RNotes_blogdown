The janitor package by [Sam Firke](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) contains probably my FAVOURITE R function: `clean_names()`. By default when I am reading data into R, I pipe `clean_names()` onto the end of my `read_csv()`. I never have to look at inconsistently formatted variable names. But janitor package includes lots of other useful functions that make it easier to deal with dirty data and count stuff. 

```
new_df <- read_csv(here("data", "df.csv") %>%
        clean_names())
        
```        

# Exploring package functions

Are you keen to dig into the little known functions of a package that you use all the time? Here is a tip: in console type the name of the package with a double colon (i.e. janitor::), all the functions in the package will pop up and you can explore them by scrolling up and down the list. 

Alternatively you can load the package in the console and then use `ls("package:packgename")` to get a list of all the objects in the package. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)

ls("package:janitor")
```


Lets try a few these functions. 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # so I have dplyr
library(janitor)  
library(palmerpenguins) # to get penguin data
library(kableExtra) # for nice tables
library(gt) # for really nice tables
```

# read some dirty data

The penguin data isn't very dirty out of the package, but I added some funky things for illustrative purposes. 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dirty <- read_csv("penguin_raw_dirty.csv")
```


# 1. clean_names()

The penguin variable names are not great. A nasty mix of capital and little letters, gaps and brackets- not fun to type over and over again. 
```{r}

names(dirty)

```

`clean_names()` will take all the variable names and make them lower case and replace gaps/brackets with underscores. 

```{r}
clean <- dirty %>%
  clean_names()

names(clean)
```


# 2. remove_empty()

Sometimes dirty data contains whole rows or columns that are empty. You can quickly remove them with `remove_empty()`. By default it is a "quiet" function, but specify quiet = FALSE and it will give you a little feedback about what it has done. 

```{r}
empty <- clean %>%
  remove_empty(which = c("rows", "cols"), quiet = FALSE)

```

# 3. get dupes()

Lets imagine an RA made a mistake and entered the data for a couple of penguins twice. `get_dupes()` will tell you if there are duplicate entries in your dataset. 

```{r}
empty %>%
  get_dupes(sample_number, species)

```

Then you can remove the duplicates with the `distinct()` function from `dplyr`. It only keeps distinct observations.

```{r}
dupes_gone <- empty %>%
  distinct()

dupes_gone %>%
  get_dupes(sample_number, species)
```

# 4. tabyl()

But perhaps the most surprisingly awesome function in the janitor package is `tabyl()`. Counting things in R is surprisingly hard [see post](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/counting-things/), but `tabyl()` is a huge help. 

Advantages...

- works with %>%
- takes a dataframe 
- outputs a dataframe
- is compatible with other table packages like `kableExtra` and `gt`

### one variable (gets you %)

```{r}

dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species) 

```

### two variables

```{r}
 
dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex)
```
Hmmmm why is there a "." column? Turns out for one penguin their sex is entered as "." instead of NA. 

Use `na_if()` from `dplyr` to convert pesky values to NA.

```{r}

dupes_gone$sex <-  na_if(dupes_gone$sex, ".")

dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex)

```

### three variables

```{r}
dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex, island) 

```


### adorn_ ing things

#### totals by row and/or col

```{r}

dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex) %>%
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col"))

```

#### percentages 
```{r}
dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row")
```

#### percent formatting
```{r}
  dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()
```



# 5. tabyl + other nice tables (kableExtra, gt)

The nice thing is that the output of `tabyl()` can be assigned as a dataframe object in your environment OR you can pipe on a `kable()`...
```{r}
dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kable() 
```

... or a `gt()` to get a really nicely formatted summary table

```{r}
dupes_gone %>%
  tabyl(species, sex) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  gt()
```
