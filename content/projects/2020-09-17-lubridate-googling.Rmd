I have set myself a challenge of learning to deal with dates in R. Nothing like setting a date for an R-Ladies Sydney event where you will teach other people to spur the motivation for learning how to use the `lubridate` package. 


The plan is to learn how to use the package and document my learning process along the way so that at the end of Oct I can tell everyone...

1. how to deal with dates in R and 
2. how to learn about a new package from the very beginning

So where to start? 

Google of course. Tonight I spent a little time looking for books, blogs, youtube videos, documentation, and twitter threads about lubridate. I have no idea whether any of these links will be useful, but they will be here for reference anyway. 

### 1. books

R4DS has a [chapter about dates/times](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html). 

[vanderbult bio stat](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/ColeBeck/datestimes.pdf)

[Mike Mahoney lecture book](https://bookdown.org/mikemahoney218/LectureBook/working-with-dates-and-times.html)


### 2. blogs

[Julia Silge re lubridate and theatre](https://juliasilge.com/blog/lubridate-london-stage/)

Ooooo i got excited about this one and it derailed my googling for a bit because this blog post does exactly what i think a good blog tutorial should do. The dataset is key right? You need to find a dataset that requires the thing you are trying to learn, because it adds motivation your learning. In this case Julia's blog is about history and theatre- fun! 

Reading this blog derailed my google process by making me want to mimic her process. I need a cool dataset to play with. Maybe the penguins have dates? Covid testing rates over time would be interesting.... hence the choppy code at the end of this post.... 

Wait wait wait, one step at a time Jen. Compile the resources you need, and then find a dataset to work with. 

Thanks for getting me excited about the process Julia!

[Rebecca Barter's blogs are always good](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/categories/lubridate/)

### 3. you tube

I didn't look very hard on youtube, this one might be ok...

### 4. package documentation

https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/

Interesting that, for me, package documentation is almost the last place I look for learning inspiration. Why is that.... to unpack later. 

### 5. twitter

I learn a lot about #rstats on twitter. People post about their blog posts, or data challenges and other kind souls help them out. Links to potentially useful threads below.

### 6. art

I found Allison's art re lubridate on twitter, but it is SO CUTE that it deserves its own category.

## Issues to explore

- sometimes R reads dates in as dates, and other times not
  + how to make R recognise dates as dates
  + how to work with dates once you have date format
- how to use date components (year, month, day) in plots, btw label = TRUE seems awesome
- making your raw dates be automatically read as such, how to make your date data easy for others?
- clash with here::here, new version of lubridate won't have here() function?? that was the word from Hadley Apr 3 2020- check whether there has been a new release. 

## ignore below here, I got distracted

```{r}

library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

#### penguins

Maybe the palmer penguin package has interesting date data? 

Yes there are dates in the raw file but not the cleaned up one. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

penguins <- penguins_raw

glimpse(penguins)
```

Well that is nice, when you read the penguin data the dates are already in date format. No need to convert. 

#### covid testing

hmmmm I think this might be where I've been put off lubridate before. here::here clashes with lubridate, such that if you have both packages loaded you need to specificy here::here- thats annoying. Link to [Jesse twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1245532577932414976) where Hadley says here is being removed from lubridate in the next release. I wonder when that is??? Maybe I need to update my lubridate. 

```{r}
## this one works fine
tests <- read_csv(here::here("data", "pcr_testing_table2_age_group.csv"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
## this one doesn't b/c here issue

cases <- read_csv(here("data", "confirmed_cases_table4_likely_source.csv"))

glimpse(tests)
```

Yay COVID test data also has date format. I wonder how you make your raw data be automatically read in as dates. Mine never is...

```{r}

options(scipen = 999)  

test_count <- tests %>%
  group_by(month(test_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  count(age_group) %>%
  rename(month = `month(test_date, label = TRUE)`) 

# label = true is sweet!

test_count %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n, colour = age_group, group = age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "COVID tests per month", title = "NSW testing rates per month")
  
```


> This data is from 17-9-2020, but seems like the NSW Chief Health Officer is right to be concerned about testing rates!
