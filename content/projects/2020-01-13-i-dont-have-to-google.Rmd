# My 2020 Resolution

There are a lot of things I do in R that I have to google EVERY TIME. My 2020 R resolution is to try and google less. I want to commit a few of these really frequently used things to memory. The key to that: write a blog post about each one. That way, even if it doesn't stick, I can always just google my own blog. 

# Things covered so far...

1. [working with factors](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/projects/working-with-factors/)
2. [counting things](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/projects/counting-things/)
